**Hello there,**

Welcome to my GitHub page(s). I am Selai Anwary, a full-stack engineer based in the Netherlands, Utrecht and I currently work for a fintech company in Amsterdam. 

In the past I've used many different ways of learing and sharing knowledge. But, writing a blog was never one of them. Although, I did use several platforms as reference book for learning. Every now and then I come a cross a new concept or idea and I usually would write these down on paper (on a notebook) and forget about them later. 

As software engineers we rely on the community to help us with our problems and to share knowledge with each other. This blog will be a way for me to share the knowledge that I have and to explore new ideas and concepts. It is also a way for me to record the progress I'm making and to offload my head into writing - instead of running ideas through my head and never doing anything productive with them.

I will also be use this site to publish my writing on [Medium](https://selaianwary.medium.com). And, I look forward to your feedback, as I am still learning how to blog.
